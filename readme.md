# WiFi EveryWhere

## About

Nowadays there seems to be WiFi everywhere we are. Coffee shops, restaurants, airports, etc. provide "open" hot spots (if a password is posted on a wall or given out to everyone it's no longer a "secure" hot-spot. Therefor these will get bundled into the "open" hot-spot group). While going around it would be useful to be able to connect to these hot-spots on your phone without much hassle. However to do that now, one must go through several hoops to get onto the Internet. We have to open our WiFi settings, connect to the network,go through some portal, and then finally get to the Internet.  WiFi EveryWhere is removing the manual tasks, allowing android users to connect to "open" WiFi wherever it's possible.

## Project Stages

The stages for this project are as follows:

- [] Bypass captive portals and connect to the Internet
- [] Implement system to share "open" hot-spot passwords
- [] Enable system to protect connection a.k.a. turn vpn on when connected to "open" hot-spot (only if the person has a vpn)
